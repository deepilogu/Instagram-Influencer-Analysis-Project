# Instagram Influencer Analysis Project

## Overview
The Instagram Influencer Analysis Project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about Instagram influencers. The dataset includes various features such as rank, username, influence score, number of posts, followers, average likes, engagement rate, total likes, and country of origin. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to gain insights into the characteristics of Instagram influencers and answer specific questions related to their influence and engagement.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **rank**: Rank of the influencer.
- **channel_info**: Username of the Instagrammer.
- **influence_score**: Influence score of the users.
- **posts**: Number of posts made by the influencer.
- **followers**: Number of followers of the influencer.
- **avg_likes**: Average likes on influencer posts.
- **60dayeng_rate**: Last 60 days engagement rate of the influencer.
- **newpostavg_like**: Average likes on new posts by the influencer.
- **total_likes**: Total likes received by the influencer on their posts (in billion).
- **country**: Country or region of origin of the influencer.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the project are as follows:
1. Identify correlated features in the dataset and determine the correlation coefficient of highly correlated pairs.
2. Determine the frequency distribution of influence score, followers, and posts.
3. Identify the country housing the highest number of Instagram influencers and visualize the count of influencers in different countries using a bar chart.
4. Identify the top 10 influencers based on followers, average likes, and total likes.
5. Describe the relationship between pairs of features using suitable graphs (e.g., scatter plots, line plots, etc.).

## Steps to Execute the Project
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset containing information about Instagram influencers.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and answer specific questions.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the data using appropriate plots and charts to facilitate understanding.
5. **Answering Questions**: Answer the questions posed based on the analysis and insights gained from the dataset.
6. **Documentation**: Document the analysis process, findings, and conclusions in a README file.
